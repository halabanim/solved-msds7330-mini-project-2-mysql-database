MySQL Database

Question 1: Create a database called “University”. Load the data and execute SQL queries..

I have attached scripts to create the University relations and also to add data. Once you have created the schema and loaded the data. Create SQL queries to answer the following questions:

<ol>

 <li>Produce a list of all the students in the student relation, including their ID, name and department name, sorted into ascending order by their name.</li>

 <li>Produce a list of the names and salaries of professors in the Comp. Sci. and Elec. Eng. departments ordered by decreasing salary.</li>

 <li>Find all courses whose identifier starts with the string ”CS-1”</li>

 <li>Find the maximum and minimum enrollment across all sections, considering only sections that had some enrollment, don’t worry about those that had no students taking that section</li>

 <li>Create a view faculty showing only the ID, name, and department of instructors.</li>

 <li>Create a view “CSinstructors”, showing all information about instructors from the Comp. Sci. department.</li>

</ol>

Capture the sequence of queries and resulting output thereby demonstrating your database in operation. Turn in a pdf of screenshots of your database in operation.
